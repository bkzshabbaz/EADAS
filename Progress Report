1.Project Title and team member names.
  E - Elderly
  A - Asset
  D - Distress
  A - Alarm
  S - System
  
  Team - Lalita Bhaskaruni, Abhimanyu Chopra, Sammy Lin, and Nisarg Patel
  
2.Project assignments/responsibilities for each team member.
  Lalita Bhaskaruni - GSM+GPS Module
  Abhimanyu Chopra  - Heart rate Sensor (Photoplethysmograph)
  Sammy Lin         - Accelerometer and Gyroscope
  Nisarg Patel      - LCD
  
3.Brief problem description/objective of the project.
  This system will monitor a user's health information (heart rate, and vertical orientation).
  When a distress is detected either by a fall or a spike in heart rate, an SMS notification is
  sent out to a pre-configured phone number with the details of the distress.

4.The selected version of the MSP430 that will be used to implement the solution.
  MSP430FR6989 Launchpad
  
5.What MSP430 peripherals will be utilized, and modes of operation (ie: polling, interrupt, etc)
  UART
  SPI
  TIMER
  INTERRUPT
  GPIO
  Modes of Operation ? 

6.A high level block diagram showing all components to be connected to the MSP430.  This must
include number of line/type of bus connection that will be made.

7.A high level software flow chart, both for the main functional flow and interrupts.
      
      Heart Rate Sensor - Serviced by a timer interrupt every 2 ms
      LCD updated as an interrupt





8.Any challenges that do not have a clear plan/solution moving forward.
9.Need to address this comment from the professor
  Will there be a user setup to set the phone number for the SMS or will be fixed.  Maybe a something that can be 
  entered using the input keys.
